##openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

```
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabe0577/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh
```

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###Modification

This script working over the tcp protocoll and allows you to create a VPN connection over port 443 and protocoll tcp, it behaves like a https request. Also the script allows the client-to-client connection, so the devices in the private network can communicate with other devices of the private network.
